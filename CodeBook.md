Activity values in both files are integers. The meaning of each value is indicated in the file activity_labels.txt: id activity 1 Walking 2 Walking Upstairs 3 Walking Downstairs 4 Sitting 5 Standing 6 Laying Those are also the values used in the tidy dataset.

The variable subjectID assumes the values 1 thru 30 and identifies the subject wearing the Samsung device

Additional info from the original dataset publisher

The unit for all the angular velocity variables is radians/second. The unit for all the acceleration vriables is standard gravity units 'g'. All numerical measures are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

angle: Angle between two vectors. Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable: gravityMean tBodyAccMean tBodyAccJerkMean tBodyGyroMean tBodyGyroJerkMean
